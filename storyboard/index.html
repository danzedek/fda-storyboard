<p class="dropcap-big">When Claudette Cyr
reached her early seventies, she began to worry about Alzheimer’s. Though the
retired math teacher’s mind was still sharp, her mother had died with the
disease. Whenever Claudette would misplace her keys or forget a name, she
dwelled on the possibility that she too would begin the slow, inexorable slide
into cognitive decline, personality changes and ultimately, dementia. </p>

    <div class="grid-ten">
    <div class="content-body"> 

<p>Then Claudette’s husband, Donald, met a physician at his weekly hockey game. The doctor owned a
private memory clinic nearby and told Donald that he was enrolling patients in
a clinical trial to test a new drug that the manufacturer hoped to show could
slow symptoms of Alzheimer’s. After attending an information session at the
clinic, Claudette and Donald decided she should sign up for the trial. </p>

<p>The decision surprised two of her stepchildren, Pierre and Mireille, who live near their
parent’s home, just outside Ottawa, Canada.  “She shopped and cooked, played
bridge, did volunteer work.”</p>

<p>Claudette seemed to do well on the drug at first, and things seemed even more promising when the
Food and Drug Administration approved it for sale in June of 2021. But that
same month, an MRI of Claudette’s brain showed evidence of brain swelling and
bleeding, two known side effects of the drug. </p>



<p >After an infusion in July, Claudette suddenly began showing signs of confusion. On August 18th,
while sitting at the kitchen table, she lost consciousness and began
convulsing. Donald, her husband of 34 years, laid her on the floor and called
for help. Her seizures didn’t stop even when paramedics arrived with
medication. Once at the hospital, she received numerous tests, and after
several days, the doctors decided she could be moved to a rehabilitation
facility. But just before the transfer, more seizures struck, and she was put
on life support in the ICU. </p>


<p >A month later, Claudette was dead. The cause, according to the physician in charge of the
clinical trial in Ottawa, was severe cerebral edema, or brain swelling, a known
side effect of the drug she had been taking.</p>

<p>That drug was
Aduhelm, which set off of a firestorm of controversy when the FDA approved it
because of the poor quality of the scientific evidence used by the agency to
justify its decision. According to the studies submitted to the FDA by Biogen,
the drug’s manufacturer, the drug not only failed to slow the onslaught of
Alzheimer’s symptoms, it caused brain bleeds and brain swelling in up to a
third of patients. But for all the public outrage directed at the FDA for
compromising science to push through Aduhelm, this one drug reflected a darker,
hidden secret: It was just one of hundreds of drugs the agency allowed on the
market despite a glaring lack of evidence that they work, and in many cases,
clear signs that they pose a serious risk of harm. </p>

<p> That is the finding of a year-long  investigation
by <i>The Conversation</i> and the McGraw Center into the FDA’s modern drug
approval process.  The investigation examined every drug approved by the FDA
over the past decade, evaluating all of the scientific studies used by the agency
for its decision. The analysis of the data was then vetted by a 15 member expert
advisory committee assembled by the reporters on this investigation, a group
that included internationally renowned physicians, epidemiologists,
statisticians, a patient representative who sits on an FDA advisory committee,
two former FDA advisors and a former FDA scientist. The reporting also involved
government documents and court proceedings, as well as dozens of interviews
with other drug experts, patients, patient advocacy groups, lawyers, and
government officials. The investigation found that over the past decade:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The FDA approved 85% of new drugs without evidence that they work.</li>

    <li>The agency allowed some drugs to remain on the market even when studies conducted after approval failed to show any benefit to patients.</li>

    <li>While only 9% of Americans have rare diseases, 54% of FDA approvals in 2022 were for “orphan drugs” that treat such conditions. Orphan drugs are far more profitable and allows companies to retain exclusive rights for longer. </li>

    <li>The FDA applied less substantive reviews to 72 new antibiotics after designating them as “substantially equivalent” to drugs already on the market. Yet all but one of those new drugs were worse than antibiotics already available, were more expensive, and offered no additional benefits.</li>

    <li>Eighty-one percent of drugs are rushed through the approval process through “expedited pathways,” which rely on lower levels of scientific evidence for the FDA’s decisions. Such faster approvals are supposed to be reserved for potentially life-threatening diseases, like cancer However, drugs for non-life-threatening conditions like migraine and psoriasis are also being hurried through</li>
</ul>
        
        


<p>The decline of science at the FDA is not just an academic question. It has come at a
tremendous cost to the public: <a href="https://ethics.harvard.edu/blog/new-prescription-drugs-major-health-risk-few-offsetting-advantages#:~:text=About%20128%2C000%20people%20die%20from,a%20leading%20cause%20of%20death.">128,000 people die</a> each year from prescription drugs for everything from diabetes to depression, arthritis, blood
clots, strokes and cancer. That doesn’t count people who overdose, or take
narcotics, or who have been prescribed the wrong drug or the wrong dose. Drugs
like Vioxx, which killed an estimated <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/morning-breakout/dr00027781/">30,000 to 55,000</a> patients from heart attacks before it was withdrawn from the market, or a <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM198908103210629">class of drugs</a> used to prevent
abnormal heart rhythms that caused <a

<p>New drugs are routinely seen as “innovative” and lifesaving. Yet this investigation shows
that many new drugs offer no improvement over older drugs, and thanks to a bag
of statistical tricks are sometimes dangerously worse. Many of these
medications come with eye-popping price tags that are orders of magnitude
greater than the price of equally effective older drugs.</p>

<p class="dropcap-big">An unlikely sponsor joined in the spectacle at the 1933 World’s Fair in Chicago. The fair’s
theme, “Technological Innovation,” featured cigarette-smoking robots, real
babies in incubators, and Cadillac’s new V-16 automobile. But innovation would
be put on trial in an exhibit dubbed the “<a
href="https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/histories-product-regulation/american-chamber-horrors">American Chamber of Horrors</a>,” with a surprising sponsor: the US Food &amp;
Drug Administration. The agency’s traveling exhibit, then housed at the World’s
Fair and later shown at the White House, displayed some of the harmful and
deadly “miracle” drugs the agency said it was powerless to remove from the
market. Powerless, it said, because drug makers had banded together to win the
support of Congress to limit the FDA’s power to protect the public.</p>

<p >The 1906 law creating the FDA failed to grant  the agency any power to require drug
makers to prove their products were either safe or effective. It could only require
that drug labels accurately reflect the ingredients in the medications. If the
label said <i>heroin</i>, (sold as tablets by Eli Lilly, Inc.), fine. If it
said <i>radioactive water</i>, (sold as Radithor by Bailey Radium
Laboratories), fine. Safety be damned. The reasoning went: <i>if a drug doesn’t
work or isn’t safe, patients won’t buy it. </i>But that belief proved deadly.</p>

<p>One of the FDA’s displays featured E.M. Byers, a wealthy industrialist and athlete, who
over a period of years swallowed hundreds of doses of Radithor, which was
touted to treat impotence and other ailments. The treatment ultimately killed
Byers, but not before causing prolonged suffering and disfigurement. A picture
shows his face and head deformed by the radiation-induced cancers that ate away
his jawbone and teeth and burrowed holes in his skull.  Another display centered
on Banbar, said to be a cure for diabetes. The drug contained milk sugar and
horsehair. Despite its utter lack of benefit for diabetics, some patients swore
by the drug. But the FDA tracked down their death certificates showing the
grateful patients died of untreated diabetes – at a time when insulin was
widely available.</p>

<p>It would take one more scandal, however, to finally trigger a Congressional
investigation. That came in 1937 with the deaths of more than 100 children and
adults who took purported remedy for strepthroat. The elixir of <a
href="https://www.fda.gov/files/about%20fda/published/The-Sulfanilamide-Disaster.pdf"></a>diethylene glycol – the chief ingredient of antifreeze – caused slow and painful deaths. One mother described her
daughter’s screams prior to her death as so awful that she felt she would go
insane. Congress finally acted and in 1938 passed<a
href="https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/changes-science-law-and-regulatory-authorities/part-ii-1938-food-drug-cosmetic-act#:~:text=FDR%20signed%20the%20Food%2C%20Drug,adequate%20directions%20for%20safe%20use."> the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act</a>, empowering the FDA to require evidence of safety before drugs went on the market. Twenty-five years later, the 1938 act was credited with dramatically limiting the catastrophe caused by 
<a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-the-thalidomide-scandal-led-to-safer-drugs"> thalidomide</a>, which caused babies to be born without arms
or legs and instead with what looked like flippers sprouting from their
shoulders or hips. While the drug affected thousands of children in other
countries, the number in the US was limited thanks to a decision by Dr. Frances
Oldham Kelsey, the FDA commissioner. But she was attacked by the drug maker and
FDA managers for her actions that saved so many children from difficult lives.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4101807/">Kefauver–Harris Amendments of 1962</a> that congress granted the FDA the right to insist not only on safety, but on <i>efficacy. </i>For the first time, the agency could demand that pharmaceutical companies provide evidence that their
drugs actually <i>work.</i> The 1962 act led to rigorous scientific standards
that made the FDA the global leader in drug regulation. Government agencies in
other countries would often wait to see how the FDA handled new drug
applications before taking their own actions. Despite a number of flaws, it
would be a golden era of scientific rigor that was unfortunately cut short by
push back from AIDS activists, Big Pharma, and the deregulation frenzy of the
1980s. </p>

<p class="dropcap-big">In 1988CKTK, Gregg
Gonsalves was TK years old and in love. He had dropped out of Tufts College
just shy of his degree and was working in a university lab in Cambridge, Mass.,
when his boyfriend of just one month came to Gonzalves’ apartment, drunk and weeping.
They had to break up, he said, because he was HIV positive.</p>  

<p>Gonsalves had heard of AIDS but had no idea how it was transmitted or how lethal it was.  “I
was this sheltered Catholic kid from Long Island who had gone to an elite
college with a bunch of other sheltered kids,” he recalls. The Reagan
Administration had ignored the crisis of AIDS, then referred to as the “gay
plague” and “gay related immune deficiency,” until 1986, a month before the
president’s friend, Rock Hudson, died of the disease. Desperate for
information, Gonzalves saw a flier for a meeting on the topic and decided to
attend.</p>

<p>The event was held
by the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, better known as ACT UP.  At that first
meeting and subsequent ones, Gonzalves found information and validation as a
gay man. Soon he joined ACT UP’s “Science Club,” a group dedicated to learning all
they could about the disease, potential treatments, and the FDA’s regulatory
process. He and other activists sneaked into university libraries to read
articles in medical journals. They pored over government documents.</p>


<p>ACT UP wanted access to new drugs, and
they wanted them fast. But they were up against an FDA bureaucracy that was, in
the words of Lewis Grossman, a professor of law at Washington University,
“almost inert” when it came to approving new AIDS treatments. ACT UP used civil
disobedience tactics, like standing up in unison at scientific meetings to
shout their slogan, “Drugs into bodies.” With news cameras rolling, ACT UP
members blockaded the entrance to FDA headquarters, near Washington, DC,
holding placards saying <a
href="https://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/facsch_lawrev/761/#:~:text=This%20Article%20explores%20how%20AIDS,expedite%20the%20availability%20of%20new%2C">“Federal Death Administration”</a> while others scaled the walls of the building. They lay on the street holding
cardboard tombstones that read “Killed by the FDA.” They went to drug
companies, eventually forcing FDA officials to sit down and discuss ways to
speed up the approval of new drugs for AIDS. In response, the FDA began to
loosen the hard-won rules instituted in 1962 after the thalidomide disaster.  </p>

<p>The 1962 standards had been<a
href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?fr=314.126">
written into the code of federal regulations</a>.The  rule required two or more “gold standard” studies, known as randomized,
controlled clinical trials, or RCTs. In design, an RCT is simple: half of the subjects
get the experimental treatment; the other half are assigned to a “control
group.” The two groups are divided in a way intended to ensure that the only
difference between the two groups is the drug they receive. Those in the
control group get either a placebo (sugar pill) or “standard of care,” a
treatment that already exists.  At the end of the study, researchers examine
how many patients who received the new treatment did better or worse compared
to those in the control group.      </p>

<p>But requiring two RCTs  meant that new
treatments for AIDS (and pretty much all drugs) headed toward potential
approval like chilled molasses being sucked through a straw. It took an average
of 8 years to move drugs through the development pipeline and onto the market.
Many people with AIDS, abandoned by their government and often by their
families, died alone or on the streets as the FDA seemed to dither.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Congress sat on its hands. The
Reagan era of deregulation and smaller government was in full throttle and
Congress refused to provide additional funding that the FDA needed to hire more
drug reviewers. </p>
                    
<p >Pharmaceutical companies raged about the sluggish pace of approvals. Every month that a drug
sat on a reviewer’s desk was a month of lost revenue, while for AIDS patients the
delays meant that the diagnosis was always a death sentence. “People were
mixing up crazy cocktails in their bathtubs,” says Gonsalves. “They were
willing to put anything in their bodies.” ACT UP demanded access to
experimental drugs once showed even modest evidence of safety and they wanted
faster approvals.</p>

<p>Having gotten the attention of the FDA with its guerilla tactics, ACT UP members and other AIDS
activists joined with drug makers and sat down with the FDA to fashion a new
“pathway” for approvals. They worked out a set of regulations allowing
companies to design shorter studies that the agency might deem acceptable. A
key component of those speedy studies was they no longer had to look at a
“clinical” endpoint, such as lengthening life or curing opportunistic
infections.</p>

<p>Thanks to a 1988 rule allowing these “Fast Track” approvals, drug makers could slash development
time by years though one simple change in the approval process: instead of being
forced to wait for years to prove that a drug could provide a <i>clinical </i>benefit
(such as living longer or feeling better), they could submit studies using a
“surrogate endpoint” said to be “reasonably likely to <i>predict” </i>a
benefit. Rather than showing actual benefit to patients, surrogate endpoints could
just use laboratory tests,  CT scans, or other non-clinical measures.. In the
case of AIDS, a commonly used surrogate was viral load – the number of HIV
viral particles detected in the blood - rather than whether the onset of AIDS
or death is delayed or reduced.</p>

<p>The logic of
surrogate endpoints might seem unassailable: If a treatment lowers the viral
load of a patient with HIV, it seemed only reasonable to assume the risk of progressing
to AIDS and dying would be decreased; if a drug cuts blood sugar in diabetics,
then it must reduced complications, from heart attacks to amputations. If a
drug shrinks a tumor, certainly a cancer  patient will live longer. These and
other surrogate endpoints have allowed industry to slash drug development from
years down to months -- and sometimes even weeks.</p>

<p>Most members of
the AIDS community celebrated the new fast track approvals. But not everyone
was cheering. Gonsalves and others in the Science Club split from ACT UP amidst
bitter arguments over the wisdom of speedier approvals. They paid attention to
the science that showed AIDS patients suffered from their use of some drugs
like AZT and DDI, two treatments approved under the new rules. Higher T-cell
counts failed to translate into a lower death rate from AIDS and the drugs had
terrible, sometimes deadly side-effects.</p>

<p>In 1993, at a meeting of the FDA’s
advisory committee for HIV drugs, Gonzalves and a handful of other activists
did the unthinkable: They asked the committee to recommend withdrawal of one of
the recently approved drugs.</p>

<p class="dropcap-big">But Gonsalves and his fellow dissidents
proved no match for the power of drug companies and their voracious appetite
for profits. Pharmaceutical leaders recognized the financial windfall to be had
if they won FDA approval for their products based on smaller, faster, less
rigorous, and less expensive studies. Industry clamored for the use of
surrogate endpoints not just for AIDS drugs, but for <i>any </i>drug. For <i>their
</i>drugs.</p>


<p>To accomplish that, drug makers employed
two tactics they learned during the AIDS crisis, tactics that over the last 40
years have proved to steadily erode the FDA’s power to protect patients. One
lesson was that patient advocacy groups, like ACT UP, could be useful in
exerting pressure on the FDA and Congress. A message from patients in favor of
speedier approvals based on lower levels of evidence proved to be a lot more
persuasive than the same demand from a company.</p>

<p>The second strategy involved persuading
the government to allow pharmaceutical companies to finance faster drug
approvals through the FDA on the argument that doing so benefited the public. The
industry lobbied Congress to approve a bill it had resisted for years: the
Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA. Under the law’s provisions, the
industry would pay fees based on their sales. Those fees would go towards
beefing up the FDA’s budget. Manufacturers had been persuaded to support PDUFA
by the Goldwater Institute and other conservative think tanks, [
9.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Quattrocento Sans",sans-serif'>Gonsalves
June 2021 interview]  12.0pt;line-height:
115%;>which railed for year about the FDA’s
speed in approving drugs.</p>

<p>PDUFA offered a way for companies to demand
benefits for industry at a dangerous cost to the public. At the suggestion of
conservative thinkers, drug makers pushed Congress for two concessions in
exchange for doling out the money: PDUFA, which legislators first passed in
1992 and renewed every five years since, directed the FDA to put the vast
majority of new funding towards hiring more reviewers and setting deadlines for
the agency to push approvals out the door.</p>



<p>In the name of speedy approvals, PDUFA
enshrined the “Accelerated Pathway,'' which allowed the use of surrogates for
any serious or life-threatening condition. This new approach required that the
company perform “confirmatory” studies after the drug was on the market,
thereby moving both the physical harms and financial costs of experimentation
onto unwitting patients who rarely if ever know they are serving as the
industry’s guinea pigs. But while PDUFA loaded up the FDA with corporate cash
to rush drug approvals, a miniscule amount went to monitoring those medications
for safety and efficacy after they went to market. And that translates into the
potential for patients suffering great harm if years-long confirmatory trials –
if they are even performed – show a drug does not work or is not safe.</p>

<p>This problem is underscored by Vinay
Prasad, an oncologist and professor of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the
University of California, San Francisco, who tells the story of a patient he
treated. He encountered a colleague using a chemotherapy drug called Xeloda to
treat a patient with hepatobiliary cancer. After some time on the treatment,
the man returned to the hospital when the cancer recurred. The man told Prasad
that the prior therapy had been hard, and he deeply had hoped it would work.</p>

Prasad said.  “it could only add toxicity and cost, and no one had told him
that the decision to prescribe the drug was a gamble— there was no clear

<p> The harms of taking the risk on rushed approvals was learned early by Gregg Gonsalves. Looking back, Gonsalves, the
former ACT UP activist and now professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of
Public Health, regrets the move to lower the scientific bar at FDA. With the
push to speed up approvals for AIDS drugs, “We unleashed drugs with
well-documented toxicities and we know less and less about their efficacy,” Gonsalves says. “We opened Pandora’s Box. And Pharma exploited it.”</p>

<p class="dropcap-big">Following PDUFA, drug makers declared
virtually any condition as “serious” so drugs could be rapidly pushed onto the market.
While rush to get FDA approvals, companies slow-walked the confirmatory trials
intended to show whether their drugs provided any patients with any benefit. Indeed,
some confirmatory trials have been delayed more than a decade. Since
confirmatory trials were supposed to put surrogate endpoints to the test to see
if the drug provides a clinical benefit, it might come as a surprise that 
<a accesskey=""href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2733561">
forty percent simply tested for a surrogate measure,</a> including the original surrogate used for approval.</p>

<p>Of course, drug makers generally don’t
worry about quickly completing confirmatory trials since the FDA often sets
deadlines for final reports years into the future.  In the case of the
Alzheimer’s drug, aducanumab, approved in 2021, the agency gave Biogen until
2030 to file its confirmatory trial report.</p>

<p>As the toll of lowered scientific
standards at the FDA  emerged, experts began to cite instances in which faith
in surrogates has led to tens of thousands of deaths. For example, in the
1980s, doctors commonly prescribed flecainide and other drugs  to prevent
abnormal and potentially deadly heart rhythms. Those medications had been
approved rapidly by relying on the surrogate endpoint of stopping certain
abnormal heart beats were known to trigger deadly rhythms. Stop those atypical
beats, the rationale went, and death rates would drop. prevent death.
Cardiologists believed so completely in that argument that they would not let
their patients enter clinical trials to test the drugs.</p>

<p>Finally, in 1989, researchers published
the results of <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM198908103210629"> a large randomized controlled trial</a>, that used gold standard criteria. The findings: The drugs not only didn’t stop
patients from dying, but when compared to placebo, they increased deaths 3.6
fold.</p>

<p >The seeming logic
of surrogate endpoints ignores some critical facts. For one, surrogates can
only measure benefit<i> </i>and do not -- and cannot --  reflect harms of
treatment. Consider a drug that can cut blood sugar levels while causing heart attacks
or liver failure. If blood sugar is the measure of success examined over a
period of a couple months, death from heart disease or liver failure occurring one
year or five years later would be missed.</p>

<p>Cancer drugs are particularly likely to
rely on surrogates. The seeming benefit of shrinking tumors has fooled the FDA,
doctors, and patients into believing the drugs extend survival. When
researchers finally tested whether making a tumor smaller translated into
longer patient survival, the answer was grim: The studies showed that of cancer
drugs approved based on surrogate endpoints between 2008 and 2012, 
<a
href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2463590">

only fourteen percent improved survival</a> 
over placebo or a drug already on the market. Eighty-six percent of drugs added
nothing to survival while causing serious side effects. And these drugs that
accomplished nothing or even hurt patients could cost noth of $100,000 - orders
of magnitude higher than the price of equally useful drugs already on the
market.</p>

<p>Worse, the FDA has allowed 
<a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/374/bmj.n1959.full.pdf">one-third of cancer drugs </a> to remain on the market after they failed confirmatory testing to prove they
increase survival rates or improve quality of life. Worse,  these unproven
drugs continue to be recommended and prescribed to patients who ave almost no
likelihood of  knowing the truth.</p>

<p>Nor are patients likely to know that of 71
drugs to treat solid tumors, the median survival time gained is not twenty
years, five years, or even two years. Instead, the people and their families
are financially crippling sums to gain just <a
href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/fullarticle/1891387">

2.1 months</a>; of
survival – and much of it almost certainly while suffering significant
side-effects and pain</p>

<p>Part of the problem is that medicine has
made some truly spectacular advances. Certain leukemias have been transformed
from death sentences to treatable conditions. Mind-boggling science has allowed
patients with TKTKT. [GIVE SEVERAL STRONG EXAMPLES OF BRILLIANT MEDICINE]But it
is these advances that so confuse the picture. The assumption goes that with
advances this wondrous, how is it possible that so many bad treatments are
getting past the FDA? It turns out that the wonderful and terrible exist
side-by-side and patients are not told the truth about which is which.</p>

<p>Indeed, it’s not just patients who are in
the dark. In 2016, Aaron Kesselheim, professor of medicine, and his colleagues
published the results of a survey about physicians’ knowledge regarding FDA’s
drug approval process. The survey question was simple: For FDA to approve a
drug, must the studies show: a.) a clinically important result; b.) a
statistically significant result; c.) both; d.) neither. The correct answer is
d): Neither.</p>


<p>In other words, drugs can be approved based
on surrogate endpoints without evidence of a clinical benefit, nor do
researchers need to show that the finding was unlikely to be a chance finding.</p>

<p><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2512772">Only 6 percent of doctors</a> got the answer right.</p>

<p class="dropcap-big">The thinking about treatments for cancer often
goes: <i>Even if the drug doesn’t work in clinical trials, let’s not take away hope.
</i>But selling hope, also called “Capitalizing on Despair,” shouldn’t be a product
produced and sold as a commodity on the open market.  Selling hope while
bankrupting patients and causing terrible side effects, isn’t giving hope, it’s
robbing patients of the right to choose.</p>


<p>There are many ways to mislead doctors and
the public, and a common one is to tout a “significant” benefit  while others,
prefer not to spenwhile often giving little-to-no gain in survival (one cancer
drug was approved for pancreatic cancer that extends survival by 
<a href="https://www.oncotarget.com/article/27727/text/"><i>

ten days</i></a> 
 >). For patients to
make an informed decision, they need honest information.</p>

<p>In 2004, a new “miracle” drug, Avastin,
was approved to treat breast cancer. Rushed through the accelerated pathway
based on a surrogate outcome, breast cancer patients were misled for years
about its purported benefits. Avastin was heralded as a new kind of cancer drug
that worked by cutting off the blood supply tumors need to grow. It had been
shown to increase survival in patients with advanced, or metastatic, colon
cancer. Two years later [Q: later than what? Than approval for breast cancer?]
it was approved for a common type of lung cancer, giving patients on average an
extra two months to live.</p>

<p>But Avastin wasn’t seen as a miracle drug
by everyone. Fran Visco, cofounder of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, a
patient advocacy group, notes that Avastin was approved based on the common
cancer surrogate, “progression free survival,” or PFS. But when FDA gave
Avastin the nod, at least one study had already been published showing Avastin 
<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa072113">did not improve overall survival.</a>
Genentech had begun two more studies, which looked at both PFS again and at
survival. In the meantime, the company was charging an eye-popping 
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/06/health/06avastin.html">$100,000 a year,</a>  an almost
unprecedented price at the time. Most breast cancer patient advocates lined up
behind demands for insurers, including Medicare, to pay up.</p>

<p>Still, some oncologists were dubious. Zeke
Emanuel, a prominent breast cancer specialist and head of the Office of
Bioethics of the National Institutes of Health, wrote an article in the New
England Journal of Medicine making the case that Genentech hadn’t yet shown the
drug would extend life. Payers, he argued, shouldn’t be expected to cough up
the full price Genentech was demanding when no one knew if the drug even worked.
</p>

<p>In response, three Genentech executives flew
from California to Washington, D.C. for a face -to-face meeting with Emanuel.
Sitting around a table in NIH’s Building 10, company representatives argued
with Emanuel and his colleagues, claiming that progression free survival had to
translate into longer life for the patient. Emanuel wanted evidence, not
argument.</p>

<p>The controversy spilled over into
newspapers and magazine pages, with patients and their doctors calling
insurers. With only a few cancer specialists urging caution, insurers caved.</p>

<p>Visco and a tiny of other breast cancer
advocates by then had begun to ask their own questions about Avastin.  They
consulted experts in clinical trial design and oncologists, eventually
concluding that unless Genentech’s follow-up trials found that the drug
extended life, it should be pulled from the market.</p>

<p>By 2010, the answer was in. Not only did
follow-up studies fail to confirm Avastin’s effect on progression of tumors, it
did nothing to extend survival. On the other hand, the side effects packed a
wallop, causing severe high blood pressure, bleeding, heart attacks, heart
failure, and perforations of the nose, stomach, and intestine.</p>

<p>When the FDA announced its intention to
withdraw the drug’s approval, Genentech appealed. Patient groups sent hundreds
of messages to the agency, pleading for the drug to remain on the market for
breast cancer. A few advocates sent thinly veiled threats, calling agency
employees “killers” and “TK.”</p>

<p>Unknown to much of the public or the
agency, Genentech was quietly funding many of these advocacy groups to the tune
of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Along with other drug makers, Genentech took
the message from the AIDS era that patients could have an impact on FDA
decisions and began showering them with cash. (see STORY #2).</p>

<p>Realizing how charged the issue of
withdrawing Avastin had become, the FDA bowed to the patient advocates. It
spent months re-reviewing the evidence, eventually calling a public meeting of
its advisory committee and allowing two days for testimony from patient groups.
More than 50 people signed up to speak. The vast majority told stories about
how their lives had been saved by Avastin. Only three speakers supported the
FDA’s decision, pointing out that the women who had died from the drug or from their
cancer couldn’t be there to speak for themselves.</p>

<p>One of the speakers who supported
withdrawal of the drug was Christine Brunswick of the National Breast Cancer
Coalition. Visco recalls that Brunswick, who has since died from her cancer,
arrived at the meeting with a bodyguard. She and others from the Coalition,
which made no secret of their views about Avastin, had also received threats
from other advocacy groups.</p>

<p>Despite the testimonials from patients,
the advisory committee voted 12 to 1 to revoke Genentech’s license to market
Avastin for breast cancer.  The FDA agreed and Genentech stopped marketing the
drug for breast cancer, though it continues to sell it for other cancers. And
since then, some doctors continue to prescribe it for breast cancer despite the
evidence.. WHY TK QUOTE FROM PRASAD.</p>

<p>Inside the FDA, the decision to withdraw
Avastin held a different lesson. It created so much anxiety and turmoil that
the repercussions are still felt three decades later, making the agency
extremely reluctant to force a company to take a drug off the market. While
companies have withdrawn several drugs in the intervening years, mostly for
safety reasons, the agency has forced a company to pull a drug only once [CK

<p>In a <a
href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1468-0009.12413">paper published in 2019</a>,
based on dozens of interviews with FDA employees, Matthew Herder, a lawyer and
professor at Dalhousie University School of Law in Halifax, Nova Scotia,
Canada, quoted one FDA lawyer saying, “If you suggest now that [the FDA] 
take something off the market, they just roll their eyes
at you.” Another FDA manager told Herder that many in the agency had a word for
the agency’s experience in Avastin’s withdrawal: Armageddon.</p>
