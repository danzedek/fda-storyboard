<p class="dropcap-big">Glenda R. first noticed her problem while driving to work. “The center line in the road seemed to wander off to the side of the road and then come back. “I took that road to work every day, and it’s a straight road. Her confusion turned to terror as she realized she couldn’t trust what she was seeing. “I had no idea how to keep from crashing into oncoming cars.” </p>

<p>That was eight years ago, and Glenda R., then 37, managed to pull off to the side of the road and call her husband to pick her up. Thinking she needed new eyeglasses, she scheduled a checkup. But it wasn’t new glasses she needed. There was something amiss in both of her retinas and the ophthalmologist sent her to a retinal specialist. He/she/they delivered some shocking news. Her retinas had been damaged by a drug she was taking and eyeglasses couldn’t correct it. </p>

<p>The drug was Elmiron, which Glenda had taken for nearly a decade to treat her painful bladder syndrome. Worse news would follow from the retinal specialist. The drug was not only causing her vision distortion, but even after stopping it, research was showing that her problem could progress until she was blind. The only hope to save her vision was a series of shots into her eyes every five-to-six weeks.</p>
        
<p>Glenda’s primary care doctor had prescribed the drug just one month after the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved it. Far from being concerned about taking a new medicine, Glenda was excited. It was the first drug on the market to treat her condition, which made urinating excruciatingly painful and could hurt so much it kept her awake at night. She recalls,  “I thought, hey, awesome, there’s a new drug!”</p>

<p >But it was all a lie. Glenda, like hundreds of thousands of patients and most of their doctors, believed the Food and Drug Administration’s 1995 approval of Elmiron meant that it had been proven safe and effective. Unfortunately, Elmiron is neither – and FDA officials knew they had allowed the drug onto the market despite having no valid evidence that it worked.</p>

<p >Worse, Elmiron is not unique. Rather, this medication reflects a darker, hidden secret: It is just one of hundreds the agency has allowed on the market despite a glaring lack of evidence that they benefit patients at all, and in many cases, presenting clear signs that they pose a serious risk of harm. </p>

<p>This is the finding of a year-long investigation by The Conversation and the McGraw Center for Business Journalism into the FDA’s modern drug approval process.  The investigation examined every FDA drug approved over the past decade, evaluating all scientific studies used by the agency for its decisions. The data analysis was then vetted by a 15-member advisory committee assembled by the reporters. This group of a group that includes internationally renowned experts includes physicians, epidemiologists, statisticians, former FDA officials, and more. The findings were also pieced together from government memos and other internal documents, investigators' notes, drug company and court records, as well as interviews with current and former federal officials, lawyers, and patients.</p>

<p>The investigation found that over the past decade:</p>

<p>None of this is a secret to the scientists and advisors who toil behind the thick walls of the FDA headquarters near Washington D.C. Rather, the agency has knowingly allowed pharmaceutical companies to employ statistical tricks to gain approvals of drugs with eye-popping price tags despite the negligible value – if any – they offer patients.  </p>     
        
<p>The decline of science at the FDA is not just an academic question. It has come at a
tremendous cost to the public: <a href="https://ethics.harvard.edu/blog/new-prescription-drugs-major-health-risk-few-offsetting-advantages#:~:text=About%20128%2C000%20people%20die%20from,a%20leading%20cause%20of%20death.">128,000 people die</a> each year from prescription drugs for everything from diabetes to depression, arthritis, blood
clots, strokes and cancer. That doesn’t count people who overdose, or take
narcotics, or who have been prescribed the wrong drug or the wrong dose. Drugs
like Vioxx, which killed an estimated <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/morning-breakout/dr00027781/">30,000 to 55,000</a> patients from heart attacks before it was withdrawn from the market, or a <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM198908103210629">class of drugs</a> used to prevent
abnormal heart rhythms that caused <a
href="https://www.abebooks.com/9780684804170/Deadly-Medicine-Why-Tens-Thousands-0684804174/plp"></a>
Adding to the death toll are drugs to treat <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/prescription/hazard/fenphen.html">obesity</a><a
href="https://d.docs.live.net/e6900d2b69e6e2ce/Documents/Journalism%20%5e0%20my%20articles/2023%20Project/Article/Americas%20Chamber%20of%20Horrors%20-%20Copy2.docx">heartburn</a>, and <a

<p>Such statistics may seem surprising given some truly spectacular advances in medicine over the last several decades. New drugs have transformed certain leukemias from death sentences to treatable and sometimes even curable conditions. Other drugs allow people with transplanted organs to live normal lives, and once-deadly infections are now cured with new antibiotics. These genuine breakthroughs have cast a golden light on all new drugs, allowing manufacturers to portray almost every fresh FDA approval as providing improvements over the old.</p>
        
<p>But experts like Jerome R. Hoffman, professor emeritus of medicine at UCLA and the head of this investigation’s database analysis advisor group, say the breakthroughs are overwhelmed by a flood of unproven and harmful drugs pouring onto the market with FDA’s stamp of approval. “Some people will see the harm that this study demonstrates as a condemnation of science, but (instead) it’s a condemnation of bad science,’’ Hoffman said. “Similarly, this isn’t a repudiation of government, but rather of government allowing itself to be captured by industry.”</p>        
        
<p>Even some of the FDA critics expressed shock when shown the findings of this investigation. “I've been discouraged about FDA before, but this is the worst,” said Diana Zuckerman, president of the Washington, DC-based National Center for Health Research. “Now I feel like every single director [at the agency] is doing the wrong thing. The scientific bar is now so low it would be impossible to lower it any further because it’s already in the dirt.”  </p>

That would make it one of the most powerful government bodies not just in the U.S. but in the world.

    <div class="content-body">
<p >When the agency was created by Congress in 1906, it had no power to compel drug makers to prove their products were either safe or effective. Instead, manufacturers had only to list the ingredients on their labels. If the label said heroin, (sold as tablets by Eli Lilly, Inc.), fine. If it said radioactive water, (sold as Radithor by Bailey Radium Laboratories), fine. Drug companies argued and Congress agreed that the free market would resolve any problems, since consumers wouldn’t buy a drug if it didn’t work or wasn’t safe.</p>

<p>Not all members of the public were quite so skeptical. At the 1933 World’s Fair in Chicago, which featured such technological wonders as cigarette-smoking robots and real babies in incubators, the FDA tried to drum up support for its bid to gain more authority with an exhibit dubbed the “American Chamber of Horrors.” There were gruesome photos of E.M. Byers, a wealthy industrialist, who over many years swallowed hundreds of doses of Radithor, a concoction that blended radium with water and supposedly cured a variety of ailments including impotence. The radiation in the drug ultimately killed Byers, but not before triggering cancers that ate away his jawbone and teeth and burrowed holes in his skull. </p>
        
<p>Another display centered on Banbar, a drug containing milk sugar and horsehair that its promoters touted as a cure for diabetes. Despite Banbar’s utter lack of benefit, some patients swore by it. When the FDA tracked down their death certificates, all had died of untreated diabetes – at a time when insulin was widely available.</p> 

<p>Four years later, a national scandal finally triggered Congressional action. More than 100 children and adults died from a purported remedy for strep throat, an elixir of sulfanilamide that had been sweetened with diethylene glycol, an organic compound that is now known to cause slow and agonizing deaths. Testifying before Congress, one mother described her daughter’s deathbed screams prior as so awful that she feared she would go insane. The following year, lawmakers passed the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, empowering the FDA to require evidence of safety before drugs could be sold</p>

<p>Yet it took another scandal before Congress allowed the agency to demand evidence that drugs actually worked. In the 1950s and early 1960s, pregnant women who had taken thalidomide to prevent nausea began giving birth to babies with deformed arms and legs that looked like flippers. Its use was limited in the United States thanks to an FDA scientist, Dr. Frances Oldham Kelsey, who saw reports from Europe of the horrific side effect and refused to grant approval.  </p>
        
<p>The near-catastrophe spurred Congress to pass the Kefauver–Harris Amendments of 1962, giving the FDA the right to insist on studies proving not only safety, but also efficacy before allowing drugs onto the market. For the first time, the agency could demand that pharmaceutical companies provide evidence that their drugs actually work.  The rigorous scientific standards developed in the wake of the 1962 act made the FDA the global leader in drug regulation. </p>

<p>But the gold standards of scientific rigor began to crumble in the 1980s, in large part from the most unlikely of causes: The AIDS crisis.

<p class="dropcap-big">Gregg Gonsalves was 22TK years old and in love. A college dropout who had taken a job at a university lab in Cambridge, Mass., Gonsalves was surprised when his boyfriend of one month showed up at his apartment, drunk and weeping. For Gonsalves’s safety, they had to break up, the boyfriend said. He was HIV positive.</p>  

<p>Gonsalves had heard of AIDS but had no idea how it was transmitted or how lethal it was.  “I was this sheltered Catholic kid from Long Island who had gone to an elite college with a bunch of other sheltered kids,” he recalls. Desperate for information, Gonsalves saw a flier for a meeting on the topic and decided to attend.</p>

<p>The event was held by the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, or ACT UP.  At that first meeting and subsequent ones, Gonsalves gained knowledge about AIDS and a sense of validation as a gay man. Soon he joined ACT UP’s “Science Club,” a group dedicated to learning about the not only the disease, but also potential treatments and the FDA’s regulatory process. </p>


<p>ACT UP wanted access to new drugs – and fast. But they were up against an FDA bureaucracy that was, as one chronicler of the period put it, “almost inert” when it came to approving new AIDS treatments. ACT UP used civil disobedience tactics. With news cameras rolling, its members blockaded the entrance to FDA headquarters holding placards saying “Federal Death Administration.” They lay on the street holding cardboard tombstones that read “Killed by the FDA.” Publicly shamed by AIDS activists and under pressure from drug companies, the FDA loosened the hard-won efficacy rules instituted after the thalidomide disaster.  </p>

<p>Those 1962 regulations required two or more “gold standard” studies, known as randomized, controlled clinical trials, or RCTs. In design, an RCT is simple: half of the subjects are randomly assigned to receive the experimental treatment; the other half are part of a “control group.” Those in the control group get either a placebo or “standard of care,” a treatment that already exists.  Researchers use random numbers to assign patients to one group or the other to ensure that the only difference between them is the drug they receive. At the end of the study, researchers examine how patients on the new treatment did compared to those in the control group. Then, the rules required that the pharmaceutical companies conduct a second trial, since drugs routinely can appear effective by chance alone. </p>

<p>But requiring two RCTs  meant that new treatments for AIDS (and pretty much all drugs) headed toward potential approval like chilled molasses being sucked through a straw. It took an average of 8 years to move drugs through the development pipeline and onto the market. Many people with AIDS, abandoned by their government and often by their families, died alone or on the streets as the FDA seemed to dither.</p>

<p >Pharmaceutical companies raged about the sluggish pace of approvals. Every month that a drug
sat on a reviewer’s desk was a month of lost revenue, while for AIDS patients the
delays meant that the diagnosis was always a death sentence. “People were
mixing up crazy cocktails in their bathtubs,” says Gonsalves. “They were
willing to put anything in their bodies.” ACT UP demanded access to
experimental drugs once showed even modest evidence of safety and they wanted
faster approvals.</p>    

<p>Having won the FDA’s attention through the guerilla tactics, activists sat down with drug makers and the agency to fashion a new set of regulations allowing for shorter reviews. Eventually, all sides agreed on newly designed, speedy studies that no longer required examining a “clinical” endpoint, such as lengthening life in the face of HIV infection or curing opportunistic infections. </p>

<p>Instead, drug makers could submit studies using “surrogate endpoints” said to be “reasonably likely to predict” a benefit. Those could be laboratory tests, CT scans, or other measures. With AIDS, a commonly used surrogate was T-cell counts -- a measure of disease fighting cells in the blood – rather than whether the onset of AIDS or death was delayed or reduced.</p>

        </figure>            

<p>When rapidly produced drug applications started arriving at the FDA, some advisory panel experts reviewing the proposals expressed horror at how the new rules led to studies that showed improvements in surrogate endpoints, but virtually nothing about clinical benefits to patients,.   </p>

<p>Members of the panel reviewing AZT, held up by the drug industry and AIDS community as among the most promising proposed medication, were flummoxed at the weakness of the research. “The data is just too premature, and the statistics are not really well done,” Dr. Itzhak Brook, the panel chairman, said at the January 1987 meeting. “The drug could actually be detrimental.” </p>
        
<p>He added that he was “struck by the fact that AZT does not stop deaths. Even those who were switched to AZT still kept dying.”</p>

<p>Just two years later, researchers at the Claude Bernard Hospital in Paris produced the first comprehensive research on the benefits of AZT to patients with AIDS and AIDS-Related Complex (ARC). And they found the drug accomplished almost nothing, calling the results “disappointing.” After six months, any improvements for patients “returned to their pretreatment levels and several opportunistic infections, malignancies, and deaths occurred,’’ the French team wrote in a study for The Lancet. “Thus the benefits of AZT are limited to a few months for ARC and AIDS patients.”</p>

<p>Gonsalves and others in the Science Club had been paying attention to this and similar studies showing AIDS patients suffered tragically from drugs like AZT approved under the new rules. The dispute over the wisdom of speedier approvals grew so bitter and acrimonious that the Science Club split from ACT UP, which continued to celebrate what was little more than a pyric victory. Not only did the quickly approved drugs offer little benefit, industry wasted critical time and effort that could have gone to discovering more effective treatments.</p> 

<p>Not everyone suffered from this new system, though: Pharmaceutical companies won huge profits from drugs that, in earlier times, would have required to meet the gold standard for research prior to approval. AZT, for example, cost patients $20,000 a year in 2023 dollars, By 1995, the drug brought in $8 billion in constant dollars for its manufacturer, Burroughs Wellcome.</p> 
        
<p>Seeing such rewards available when drugs could get approved on smaller, faster, less rigorous, and less expensive studies for AIDS drugs, companies clamored to extend the same looser standards for all FDA applications. As they sought new rules to allow them to sidestep gold standard research requirement, industry campaign contributions to federal candidates reached unprecedented heights, exploding from $4.5 million in 1988 to $8.2 million in 1992, according to the Federal Election Committee and Open Secrets, an independent research group.</p>

<p>The laws that allowed for more rapid approvals began to dramatically change in 1992. That year, the FDA adopted revisions proposed by the George H.W. Bush White House that set up a two-tiered system of standard review and then a pathway called Accelerated Approval. The Bush Administration declared the rule changes were necessary to deal with the AIDS crisis, but they also expanded the number of illnesses that qualified for fast-track review.</p>

<p>Critics argued that the new rules were a gift to the pharmaceutical industry for an array drugs cloaked in concern about AIDS treatments. Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.) slammed the supposed benefits for AIDS from the new regulations, calling it a “hoax to imply that it will do more than the FDA is already doing to bring effective AIDS drugs to the market."</p>

<p>With the AIDS experience now serving as a trojan horse to decrease approval times, the pharmaceutical industry lobbied heavily to continue expanding the number of drugs that would qualify for speedier approval.  And the efforts quickly paid off. </p>

<p>In 2002, Congress approved legislation that set a new 10-month goal for all standard reviews, but it also added a designation called priority review, with a flexible deadline for approval of six months. Then, in 2007, Congress created the “fast track” designation, purportedly for investigational drugs. Then, in 2012, lawmakers approved another pathway, deemed “breakthrough therapy,” for use when preliminary clinical trials suggest a new drug might be better than standard treatment. These speedier options were supposed to be reserved for new drugs that treat “serious or life-threatening illnesses,” or “seriously debilitating diseases.” Yet this investigation found that everything from psoriasis to INSOMNIA??? have been counted as qualifying under each of these designations. </p>

<p>A study co-authored by drug expert Jerry Avorn, a physician and pharmacoepidemiologist at Harvard, found that in any given year, priority review drugs approved during the final two-month push were more likely to be withdrawn later for safety reasons compared to drugs approved earlier in the year. Drugs approved at the end of the year were four times as likely to be slapped with a boxed warning at some point after approval. A boxed warning on a drug’s label tells doctors and patients to be aware of severe side effects that can lead to hospitalization and/or death.</p>

<p>Today, Gregg Gonsalves, now a professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health, regrets his role in lowering the scientific bar for FDA approval of AIDS drugs. Never would he have imagined that the attempt to help people caught up in an unprecedented health crisis would be used as a rationale to undercut almost all drug research submitted to the FDA. “We opened Pandora’s Box,’’ he says. “And Pharma exploited it.”
The result? “We’ve arrived in hell.” </p>

<p class="dropcap-big">The advice to pharmaceutical companies was as simple as it was disquieting: Just because an efficacy study for a new drug flopped didn’t mean the manufacturer should surrender hopes in winning FDA approval. </p>


<p>“A failed late-stage clinical trial is bad news for patients, the drugmaker, and investors who made a bet that the product would be successful,’’ Frank S. David, a biopharma consultant and physician wrote in a 2023 report. “But it doesn’t always mean the end of the road for a new drug.”
Instead, David wrote, by establishing close relationships with FDA officials, there were ways drug companies could persuade regulators, “to overlook, discount, or re-interpret negative trial results en route to approving their new therapies.”</p>

<p>That lesson scarcely needs to be taught. This investigation’s review of more than 400 drugs approved by the FDA over the past decade shows that 85% were allowed onto the market despite there being no gold standard evidence that they worked. The tactics used by pharmaceutical companies to transform poor data into approval is a laundry list of medical-speak – non-inferiority, surrogate endpoints, no control group, no blinding, no replication, no clinical outcome, no meaningful effect size – that together translate into one meaning: By allowing pharmaceutical companies to sidestep gold standard scientific studies, the FDA has ushered unproven drugs of crippling cost and potential risk onto the market at a rate unprecedented since the thalidomide catastrophe. </p>

<p>Studies need to be “blinded,” which simply means the patients don’t know which drug they’re getting and neither do the researchers running the trial. Unblinded studies are notorious for producing false results because researchers and patients often want a new drug to work. When they know which patients got the drug and which one’s didn’t, they can see improvement even when it doesn’t exist. When a properly blinded study is then conducted, the benefit often evaporates. This investigation turned up HOW MANY drugs approved without the study being blinded. </p>

<p>Then there’s replication. John Ioannidis, a physician and POSITION TK at Stanford University wrote a now-famous study entitled, “Why Most Published Research Findings are False,” in which he argued that at least half of basic biomedical research and clinical studies --like the ones used by companies for drug approval -- turn out to be wrong when further tested. Other researchers have made similar findings. The bottom line is many drugs look great at first only to turn out to be less effective, if not useless, in subsequent studies.  </p>   

<p>Not replicating studies has become almost standard operating procedure for drugs in our database. More than WHAT percent TK are approved on the basis of a single study.  </p>        

<p>Many drugs offer no meaningful effect size, which simply means their effects on symptoms or the patient’s risk of death are so small as to be meaningless. A study led by Vinay Prasad, a professor of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco, found that NAME TK, a cancer drug approved for pancreatic cancer because it extends survival, does so by an average of only ten days. DRUG TK costs HOW MUCH PER MONTH. </p>

<p>Another trick the FDA allows is so-called non-inferiority trials. In 2010, the agency issued a guidance for studies that claim a drug has “non-inferiority” to another medication already on the market.  But the term is little more than Orwellian doublespeak, bearing no relationship to its implied meaning. In FDA parlance, non-inferior doesn’t mean “no worse” – in fact, it means the opposite. The new and supposedly “innovative” drug is allowed to less effective than its comparator and still win approval.</p>
 
<p>How much less? At first, the agency allowed a new drug to be up to ten percent less effective than an old one, so long as the new drug offered some other benefit, like fewer side effects or coming in pill form rather than an injection. Later, drugs that were up to 15 percent less effective could be approved.</p>

<p>The agency sunk even further when it gave the nod to Recarbrio, as astonishingly expensive drug which was more than 20 percent less effective in curing a potentially life-threatening infection than the older, far cheaper medication against which it was tested.</p>
 
<p>“This is crazy,” says Joe Fraiman, an emergency medicine physician in New Orleans and member of the team analysing this investigation’s database. “What patient with a potentially fatal infection would want Recarbrio if they knew it was less effective than an older drug and that it costs 40 times more?” </p>
 
<p>Worse, the FDA approves drugs based on non-inferiority trials even when, like Recabrio, they offer no compensating benefits, like fewer side effects. A study led by John Powers, a physician, researcher and consultant to the National Institutes of Health, led a  study of 78 antibiotic trials conducted in WHEN TK OR leading to HOW MANY APPROVALS TK found 72 of them were non-inferiority studies. Only one proposed any off-setting benefit. </p>

<p>Cancer drugs are particularly likely to rely on surrogates. The seeming benefit of keeping tumors from growing or even shrinking them has fooled the FDA, doctors, and patients into believing the drugs extend survival, but when researchers finally test whether holding a tumor steady translates into longer patient survival, the answer is often grim.  </p>
 
<p>That’s because the seeming logic of surrogate endpoints ignores some critical facts. For one, surrogates can only measure benefit; they cannot reflect harms of treatment. Consider a drug that can lower blood sugar, while causing heart attacks or liver failure. If blood sugar is the surrogate measure of success examined over a period of a couple months, death from heart disease or liver failure occurring one year or five years later would be missed.</p>
 
<p>One of the first medications approved on a surrogate endpoint was Avastin, an exciting new cancer drug approved to treat metastatic breast cancer. Women with this stage of cancer faced a dire prognosis: most would be dead within five years. Approved in 2008, Avastin represented a breakthrough in cancer medication because it didn’t simply kill cancer cells, like chemotherapy, it inhibited the growth of blood vessels, which tumors need in order to grow. Avastin was given an expedited approval based on “progression free survival,” a measurement of how long the patient lived before the tumor began growing again after treatment with other drugs, radiation, or both. </p>

<p>The FDA granted its approval on the condition that the manufacturer, Genentech, conduct a randomized controlled trial looking at whether or not women actually lived longer on Avastin. The study was also supposed to document how the drug’s more serious side effects, which included blood clots, perforated intestines, stroke, heart problems and kidney malfunction, might affect women’s quality of life and lifespan. The post-market trial, which was completed in WHEN TK, showed Avastin not only didn’t extend life, it did not even improve progression free survival. </p>

<p>“Avastin opened our eyes to surrogate endpoints,” says Fran Visco, co-founder of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, one of the few patient organizations that supported the withdrawal of the drug. Avastin would eventually be pulled from the market for breast cancer, but not without a fight from other breast cancer advocacy groups and members of Congress. That fight left the FDA bruised and reluctant to go up against companies that might refuse to pull a drug voluntarily in the future. (See Story 2) </p>
 
<p>Avastin’s failure hasn’t prevented companies from using surrogates to gain approval of dozens of other cancer medicines. This investigation turned up numerous cancer drugs approved since 2012 on a surrogate endpoint. Drugs like Copiktra, which is used to treat certain kinds of leukemia CKTK. Nearly three-quarters of patients in the clinical trial submitted by the company to the FDA, 73 percent, developed serious and/or fatal reactions on Copiktra, the most common of which were infections, diarrhea or colitis requiring hospitalization. Fatal reactions within 30 days of the last dose occurred in 12 percent of patients.  A follow-up report is not due until 2024, giving the company a good six years to kill people before anybody knows if the drug helps at least some patients live longer. </p>

<p>Then there’s Talzena, which was approved in late 2018 for breast cancer based on progression free survival. A subsequent study of Talzenna showed it provided no increase in survival. The manufacturer, WHO TK, is still marketing it for breast cancer CKTK OR it was removed from the market later that year or WHEN.</p>
 
<p>Aaron Kesselheim and his colleagues at Harvard’s interdisciplinary Program on Regulation, Therapeutics and Law published a damning study in 2019 showing that only 14 percent of cancer drugs approved on a surrogate endpoint between 2008 and 2021 improved survival over placebo or a drug already on the market. Put another way, eighty-six percent of cancer drugs approved in that four-year period added nothing to survival, caused numerous serious side effects and cost patients, taxpayers and insurers tens of thousands a dollar a year.  </p>
 
<p>Once approved, the FDA allows companies to tout their products in ways that mislead both doctors and the public. For instance, ads trumpet a “significant benefit,” without specifying that significant in this case is a statistical term that often amounts to almost nothing in terms of real survival or better quality of life. It’s hard to believe that too many patients with pancreatic cancer think the extra ten days provided by PANCREATIC CANCER DRUG FROM ABOVE is truly significant in the ordinary sense of the word, especially at a cost that could leave their family’s finances in tatters. A study led by Vinay Prasad, a professor of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco, found that NAME TK, a cancer drug approved for pancreatic cancer because it extends survival, does so by an average of only ten days. The difference between how long patients on standard of care versus DRUG TK lived was statistically significant but ten days is hardly significant in the usual sense of the word. </p>

 <p>Vinay Prasad at the University of California, San Francisco, and coauthors found that of 71 cancer drugs approved between WHEN and WHEN to treat solid tumors, the median survival time gained is not twenty years, five years, or even two years. Patients and their families are spending financially crippling sums to gain an average of 2.1 months of survival – and much of it almost certainly while suffering significant side-effects and pain.</p>
        
<p>Patients routinely overestimate their chances of being that unicorn who beats the odds and is cured or at least granted a remission from their disease. They also believe any drug approved by the FDA has been shown to be safe and effective. It’s not just patients who are in the dark. In 2016, Kesselheim’s group at Harvard published the results of a survey about physicians’ knowledge regarding FDA’s drug approval process. The survey question was simple: For FDA to approve a drug, must the studies show: a.) a clinically important result;[1] b.) a statistically significant result; c.) both; d.) neither. The correct answer is d): Neither.
Only 6 percent of doctors got the answer right. </p>
        
<p>Prasad, who is also an oncologist, recently cared for a patient with hepatobiliary cancer who had been treated with the drug Xeloda by another oncologist. After some time on the drug, the man returned to the hospital when the cancer recurred. The man told Prasad that the prior therapy had been hard, and he had deeply hoped it would work. Prasad wrote recently in a medical journal,  “I couldn’t get past the simple fact that his doctor had given him chemotherapy that had FAILED in a randomized study. It could only add toxicity and cost, and no one had told him that the decision to prescribe the drug was a gamble— there was no clear evidence of benefit.”

<p class="dropcap-big">The harms of rushed approvals was learned early on by AIDS activists, but by the time they understood what they had unleashed, the drug industry was well on its way to using an assortment of tricks to get drugs on the market and keep them there as long as possible. They declared virtually any condition as “serious” so drugs could get on the fast track. </p>

<p>Once they get a drug approved on a surrogate endpoint, companies are required by law and to perform a post-market, or confirmatory study. These additional studies are needed to show whether or not drugs that have been approved on the basis of a surrogate actually provided any patients with any real benefit. </p>

<p>It was a bargain that the FDA agreed reluctantly at first, says Mathew Herder, a legal scholar at the University of Dalhousie, in Halifax, Canada. Herder spent weeks interviewing FDA employees in WHEN TK and When TK. Over time however, agency higher ups have changed their tune. “I think rightly or wrongly, [the FDA] decided that completely bending their standards could still lead to good drugs. They put a lot of faith in post-market evidence.”</p>

<p>That faith may be misplaced. Drug companies have little incentive to spend money on studies that might or might not show their drugs are actually effective. Having rushed to market, they often slow-walk subsequent studies, sometimes by years. </p> 

<p>According to a 2022 analysis by the US Dept of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, more than one-third of drugs approved on one accelerated approval pathway have never seen their confirmatory trials. The average time for those that were completed was four years. The time companies take to perform the required studies can range from a few months to 12 years. At least two drugs are still on the market and confirmatory trials have never been submitted to the FDA. </p>

<p>Often, companies will submit a post-market study that adds no new information to what the FDA already had when it approved the drug on a surrogate endpoint in the first place. Bishal Gayawali, a professor of WHAT WHERE, and colleagues found that for cancer drugs approved between WHEN and WHEN, 40 percent of the time the company submitted a study that looked at the same surrogate endpoint it used to get the drug approved in the first place – even though that post-market study was supposed to show the drug offered an actual clinical benefit, like living longer.</p>
 
<p>Of course, drug makers may not need to worry about quickly completing post-market trials, since many of those deadlines are set years into the future.  For example, Biogen has until 2030 to file its post-market study on the Alzheimer’s drug Aduhelm. By then, the drug will be off-patent and the company will have moved on to newer, more profitable products.  When companies blow past their deadlines, the FDA rarely enforces them, which is a little like an indefinite extension on homework eaten by the dog. The agency can impose fines when companies drag their feet, but they rarely do more than send a sternly worded letter to the company pointing out its failure to produce the required study.  </p>
 
<p>Even when drugs fail their post-market trials, the FDA allows them to remain on the market an average of 4.7 [CKCK] years (and sometimes for more than a decade).  In another moment of Orwell-speak, the agency calls these failures, “Dangling approvals.” Gayawali’s study showed that out of HOW MANY cancer drugs that were approved on surrogate endpoints, only TK have been withdrawn by the company after a confirmatory trial showed the drug was ineffective. Another TK are still dangling – and being prescribed for patients despite the lack of evidence that they work.  QUOTE FROM EDITORIAL OR KESSELHEIM OR GAYAWALI</p>
 
<p>These evidence-free drugs include BRAND NAME TK, which has not been shown to be useful in DISEASE TK, but which brought in a tidy HOW MUCH TK in WHAT YEAR TK for manufacturer, WHAT TK. Then there’s TK for TK, also left dangling after a failed post-market trial. Ads for both drugs continue to appear on television.  The FDA has allowed one-third of cancer drugs to remain on the market after they failed to prove they increase survival rates or improve quality of life.</p>
 
<p>In defending dangling approvals, Richard Pazdur, a physician and the head of the cancer division at the FDA, wrote in 2021 that when a drug fails in a clinical trial, it “does not necessarily mean that the drug is ineffective.” In one sense, Pazdur is right. Not having convincing evidence that a drug works is not the same as knowing it does not work.</p>
 
<p>What it does mean is: we don’t know. The database used in this investigation shows that hundreds of drugs are now being put on the market at the we don’t know stage. In the past, having a promising surrogate endpoint was used by drug companies to decide whether proceeding to the final stage of clinical testing was worth their investment in a clinical trial aimed at showing a clinical benefit. In other words, providing substantial evidence of a meaningful benefit was something that was expected before putting a drug on the market.</p>
 
<p>“Everybody from the commissioner on down keeps telling us that approving these marginal drugs will lead to an accumulation of benefits to patients over time,” says Fran Visco. “But if a drug doesn’t work, it doesn’t work, and putting them all together doesn’t add up to an effective treatment.”

<p class="dropcap-big">In 1996, five years after Congress approved PDUFA and pharma money began pouring into the FDA, the agency was bending over backwards to help a small company get its drug over the finish line. The company was Baker Norton Pharmaceuticals, the maker of Elmiron, and every time it came to the agency with new data, the science reviewers shot it down. </p>
        
<p>The FDA had already agreed to allow Baker Norton to sell the drug before it was approved for “compassionate use,” since there were no other treatments for the condition at the time. The agency also granted the company orphan drug status for its product, even though more than a million people with the condition and the orphan drug pathway was supposed to be reserved for rare diseases with fewer than 200,000 new cases a year. </p>

<p>The company finally came in with results from two clinical trials, one of which had mixed results about the drug’s impact on bladder pain, frequent urination and incontinence, the worst symptoms of the disease. The other clinical trial supposedly showed a positive result, but there was something fishy about it. The trial had been conducted at six different sites, five of which found the drug was no better than placebo. A single site produced wildly positive results. That site happened to be run by Dr. Lowell Parsons, the patent holder of Elmiron.</p>

<p>The FDA rejected the drug and told the company to run another trial, this time without Parsons in charge of anything. Instead, Baker Norton simply reanalyzed the data and resubmitted it. Again, the FDA rejected it and told the company to conduct a real trial. In a meeting with the agency, Baker Norton representatives said the company would “not conduct a new study” (emphasis in the original FDA minutes). Instead, it would submit results based on data from patients who had been given the drug under compassionate use. The agency reluctantly agreed, but it warned the company that yet another reanalysis, even coupled with compassionate use data, represented a “third reassessment of old data that was twice deemed inadequate” and was unlikely to pass muster. </p>

 <p>On September 26, 1996, the FDA did an about face and approved Elmiron after Baker NortonOR WHAT COMPANY TK promised to do a post-market study. By then, the company already knew of numerous cases of vision loss among compassionate use patients. Yet no warning appeared on the drug’s label and millions of people would use Elmiron without a clue the drug could cause them to go blind. </p>

<p>Nearly 20 years later, in 2019, results from the long-delayed post-market study were in. This time, the study was paid for by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, which had bought the rights to manufacture and market Elmiron. The new trial was conducted by the North American Elmiron Study Group, a consortium of researchers in the U.S. and Canada that didn’t include Lowell Parsons, the drug’s patent holder.  This time around, the results were resoundingly clear: Elmiron did not improve the symptoms of interstitial cystitis. </p>

<p>Dr. Curtis Nickel served as the leader of the study group. A urologist in WHERE, Canada, he was already aware of the drug’s side effects and generally took his patients off the drug if there were any signs of vision loss. But he didn’t expect the results of the study to be completely negative. Neither did the company, he says. When he and his colleagues said they planned to publish the results, the company pushed back. “I found out the marketing people [at Janssen] didn't want to publish,” he says. Company scientists, on the other hand, felt morally obligated to get the word out and in the end, they won. The paper was published in a urological journal and Nickel presented their results at the annual meeting of the American Urological Society, which is attended by tens of thousands of urologists. ,  but the scientific people were sort of knew the moral morally, that they had to push it.  If the study had been positive, “Janssen  would have been flying me around the world” to medical conferences to talk up the drug.  </p>

<p>Janssen and its parent company, Johnson & Johnson, is facing hundreds of lawsuits from patients who have suffered everything from mild vision loss to blindness. The American Urological Association continues to. Parsons continues to reap WHAT TK from sales of the drug. Meanwhile, the FDA has yet to demand the drug be pulled from the market. </p>

<p class="dropcap-big">When Claudette Cyr reached her early seventies, she began to worry about Alzheimer’s. Though the retired math teacher’s mind was still sharp, her mother had died with the disease. Whenever Claudette would misplace her keys or forget a name, she dwelled on the possibility that she too would begin the slow, inexorable slide into cognitive decline, personality changes and ultimately, dementia.  </p> 
        
<p>Then Claudette’s husband, Donald, met a physician at his weekly hockey game. The doctor owned a private memory clinic nearby and told Donald that he was enrolling patients in a clinical trial to test a new drug that the manufacturer hoped to show could slow symptoms of Alzheimer’s. After attending an information session at the clinic, Claudette and Donald decided she should sign up for the trial. </p>
 
<p>The decision surprised two of her stepchildren, Pierre and Mireille, who live near their parent’s home, just outside Ottawa, Canada.  “She shopped and cooked, played bridge, did volunteer work,” said Pierre. “We saw no signs of dementia.”</p>
 
<p>Claudette seemed to do well on the drug at first, and things seemed even more promising when the Food and Drug Administration approved it for sale in June of 2021. But that same month, an MRI of Claudette’s brain showed evidence of brain swelling and bleeding, two known side effects of the drug.  </p>    
 
<p>After an infusion in July, Claudette suddenly began showing signs of confusion. On August 18th, while sitting at the kitchen table, she lost consciousness and began convulsing. Donald, her husband of 34 years, laid her on the floor and called for help. Her seizures didn’t stop even when paramedics arrived with medication. Once at the hospital, she received numerous tests, and after several days, the doctors decided she could be moved to a rehabilitation facility. But just before the transfer, more seizures struck, and she was put on life support in the ICU. </p>
 
<p>A month later, Claudette was dead. The cause, according to the physician in charge of the clinical trial in Ottawa, was severe cerebral edema, or brain swelling, a known side effect of the drug she had been taking.</p>
 
<p>That drug was Aduhelm, whose approval set off a firestorm of controversy in 2021 both inside and outside the agency. Biogen, the drug’s manufacturer, before the approval, had been midway through two clinical trials of the drug when its own data safety and monitoring board stopped both studies for “futility,” which means there was no difference between the decline in mental faculties of patients on the drug and those on a placebo. The drug wasn’t effective. But like Exondys 51, Aduhelm had a champion inside the FDA: this time it was Billy Dunn, the physician in charge of the agency’s neurological drug division. In a series of meetings, Biogen representatives and Dunn devised a plan for the company to reanalyze its data, a practice known disparagingly in the research community as “data dredging.”  Even then, the company’s new version of its results failed to sway FDA reviewers, who pointed to the drug’s serious side effects, including brain hemorrhage and bleeding as well as the edema that killed Claudette Cyr. HOW MANY patients died from side effects during the clinical trials. The agency’s advisory committee agreed with the scientific reviewers and voted no. Dunn and his supervisor, Janet Woodcock, approved Aduhelm anyway. </p>
